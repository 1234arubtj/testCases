Practice Test Cases Repository
Welcome to the Practice Test Cases Repository!

Purpose
This repository serves as a collection of practice test cases aimed at helping developers and testers enhance their testing skills. The test cases provided here are intentionally kept limited in number to allow for focused practice and learning.

Contents
The repository is organized into the following directories:

/unit_tests: This directory contains test cases designed for practicing unit testing. These tests focus on validating individual functions or methods within a software component.

/integration_tests: In this directory, you'll find test cases that focus on practicing integration testing. These tests aim to validate the interactions and collaboration between different components.

/end_to_end_tests: The end_to_end_tests directory hosts test cases that simulate user scenarios and interactions with the software, helping you practice end-to-end testing.

Getting Started
To make the most of this repository and practice your testing skills, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
gh repo clone 1234arubtj/testCases
Navigate to Desired Directory: Choose the type of testing you want to practice (e.g., unit_tests, integration_tests, or end_to_end_tests) and navigate to the corresponding directory.

Choose a Test Case: Select a test case from the available options within the chosen directory.

Review the Test Case: Open the chosen test case file and review the test description, expected outcomes, and any provided instructions.

Perform Testing: Implement the necessary test steps to execute the test case against the software. Compare the actual outcomes with the expected outcomes to determine the success of the test.

Reflect and Learn: After completing the test case, reflect on the experience. Did you encounter any challenges? Did you learn something new? Take notes to improve your testing skills.

Repeat: Feel free to repeat steps 3 to 6 with different test cases or directories to practice various aspects of testing.

Contributing (Optional)
